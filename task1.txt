Section A: Technical Question

1. What is the difference between var, let and const?
var: Declares variable with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope.
let: Declares variable with block scope, allowing updates but not-redeclaration within the same block.
const: Declares block scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initail assignment.

2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
      var keyword in javaScript allows variable redeclaration within the same scope. It enables this beacuse var variables are function-scoped or globally scoped and are hoisted to the top, allowing the same variable name to be re-initialized without trowing a syntax error. 

3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
     var and let allows reinitialization in javaScript.

4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
     const does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization in javaScript.

5. Why should const be used for fixed values?
     const means constant- a vlaue that should not change.
     => If prevents changes by mistake
     => It makes your code easier to understand
     => It helps avoid bugs

6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
     Syntax error will occurs. let does not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
     Type error will occurs. const cannot be changed after assignment.

8. Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
     In mordern JavaScript, the preferred keyword is const.
     => Prevents accidental changes
     => Makes code clearer
     => Helps reduce bugs
     => Best practice in modern JavaScript

9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
     No, const cannot be declared without initialization. When you declare a const variable, you must assign a value immediately.This cause an Syntax error.

10. When should var be avoided?
     => In mordern JavaScript
     => In large or team project
     => When writing clean, bugs-free code

Section B: Code-Based Question

11. Predict the output:
 var a = 10;
 a = 20;
 var a = 30;
 console.log(a);

 Output: 30

 12. Predict the output:
 let b = 5;
 b = 15;
 console.log(b);

 Output: 15

 13. Identify the error:
 let x = 10;
 let x = 20;

Ans: let does not accept redeclaration in the same scope


 14. Identify the error:
 const y = 50;
 y = 100;
 
Ans: const variable cannot be reassigned. Not accept reuse, reinitialization and redeclaration

15. Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
  var a= 18;
  a=8
  var a= 20;
  console.log(a)

  Output: 20

16. Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
  let b= 18;
  b=8;
  console.log(b)

  Output: 8

17. Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
  const c= 18;
  console.log(c)

  Output: 18
  const cannot accept reuse, reinitialization and redeclaration.

18. Convert var to let where applicable.
  In mordern JavaScript, var should usually be Convert to let because let is safe and more predictable.
  Convert var to let when the variable is reassigned and does not need function-scope behavior.
  
  var x=12;
  x= 6;

  After converted:
  let x=12;
  x=6;
  
19. Convert var to const where applicable.
  use const when the variable value does not change after it's assigned.

  var num=5;
  console.log(num)

  converted:

  const num=5;
  console.log(num)

  Do not use const if the value changes
  var num=4;
  num= 6;

  converted:
  const num=6;
  num=7; //error

20. Write your own example for var, let, and const.
  var x= 22;
  x=30;
  var x=18;
  console.log("var:",x)

Output: var: 18

  let y=20;
  y=15;
  console.log("let:",y)

Output: let: 15

  const z=30;
  console.log("const:",z)

Output: const: 30
